# Akan-Naming Nomenclature
#### Determines the day of the week of birth, 8th September 2021
#### By **Levy Omolo**
## Description
This page allows the users to key in their date, month and year to determine the day (of the week) of their birth. They are also prompted to choose their gender, whether male or female to determine their Akan names.

Now, Akan Naming, if you don't understand, is a nomenclature where in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
